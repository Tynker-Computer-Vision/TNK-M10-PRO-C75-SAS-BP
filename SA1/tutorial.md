Follow the given steps to complete this activity:

1. Split the data

* Open the main.py file.

* Create variables `training_images, testing_images, training_ages, testing_ages` to store the images after they are split.

* Set the function `train_test_split()` as their value and pass `images, ages` as parmeter in the function.

    `training_images, testing_images, training_ages, testing_ages = train_test_split(images, ages)`

* Print the length of these variables.
 
    `print("::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::")`

    `print("Number of training images ", len(training_images))`

    `print("Number of testing images ", len(testing_images))`

    `print("Number of training ages ", len(training_ages))`

    `print("Number of training ages ", len(testing_ages))`

    `print("::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::")`


* Save and run the code to check the output.
